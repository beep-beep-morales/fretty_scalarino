# Fretty Scalarino
Fretboard scale template generator

This project is an Inkscape extension used to create fretboard scale templates that are easy to print on a single, standard sized piece of paper.
Basic functionality exists but is yet untested and unverified.

Currently all the units available to the user are in inches. Not sure if it makes sense to provide a metric option.

Todo:

1. Verify accuracy of fret calculations and placement.
2. Cool logo?
3. Designate nut position with markers?
